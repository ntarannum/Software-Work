Two Issues:

- The '.exe' file is there so that CM will be able to submit your work
once you have compiled it. (Remember, you may need to navigate away
from the exercise and back again, for the 'Submit' button to become
active.)

- Have a look a the Makefile - what do you think the '.PHONY' target
is about?
